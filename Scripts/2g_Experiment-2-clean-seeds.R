## Purpose of script: This script cleans the seed data

## We import the raw seed rain matrix. Then, we trade some of the
## placeholder names with an unknown identifier, remove seeds that were
## potential contaminants from the feeder, and arrange the data in 
## alphabetical order. We export this clean data.

## We also filter seeds not likely dispersed by birds (i.e., those from the 
## canopy tree species, wind-dispersed seeds, and epizoochorous seeds 
## dispersed by mammals. We export this filtered data for supplementary models.
